This repository contains the source code for the study described in *"Cross-Car, Multiplayer Games for Semi-Autonomous Driving"* by Lakier et al. Further information on this publication is available at: https://matthewlakier.com/publications/#bibliography-LakierCarGames2019

Due to licensing restrictions, several third-party resources have been removed from this release. This prevents the terrain and the player's car interior from being rendered. Please see below for more details.

The games are implemented in the Unity game engine. They have been tested with Unity 2018.1.6f1.
